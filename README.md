# DL_COPPER
The PyTorch code for "A Deep Learning approach for exploring the design space for the decarbonization of the Canadian electricity system"
# Introduction
A supervised machine learning surrogate of a capacity expansion model is developed based on residual neural networks, accurately approximating the modelâ€™s outputs while reducing the computation cost by five orders of magnitude. This increased efficiency enables the evaluation of the outputs' sensitivity to the inputs, allowing the evaluation of system development factors relationships for the Canadian electricity system between 2030 and 2050.
